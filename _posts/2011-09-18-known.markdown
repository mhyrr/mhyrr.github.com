title: What You'll Wish You'd Known
---

An [Ask PG](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2982185) thread on Hacker News had a [comment](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2982562) so poignant I felt inclined to repost it here.  The author suggested PG make another book of essays, this one targeted at high school and college students (loosely).  Here's the OP's list:

1.  [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html)
2.  [What You Can't Say](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html)
3.  [Disconnecting Distraction](http://www.paulgraham.com/distraction.html)
4.  [The Age of the Essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html)
5.  [Why Nerds are Unpopular](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html)
6.  [Writing, Briefly](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html)
7.  [Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html)
8.  [Good and Bad Procrastination](http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html)
9.  [How to Do What You Love](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html)
10.  [See Randomness](http://www.paulgraham.com/randomness.html)
11.  [The Power of the Marginal](http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html)
12.  [How Art Can Be Good](http://www.paulgraham.com/goodart.html)
13.  [Taste for Makers](http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html)
14.  [Two Kinds of Judgement](http://www.paulgraham.com/judgement.html)
15.  [Stuff](http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html)

I would consider adding to this:

16.  [Undergraduation](http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html)
17.  [You Weren't Meant To Have A Boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html)
18.  [Keep Your Identity Small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html)
