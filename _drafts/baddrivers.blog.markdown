Title: How To Tell If You're a Bad Driver	

1 - If you're surprised often on the road.   
I don't mean by this that once a year you're amazed when a bike flies by you at 110 mph.  If you're surprised often, on a regular basis, you might be a bad driver.  Generally, a good rule of thumb on the road is to be extremely aware of your surroundings.  This means what's happening ahead of you, to your sides, and behind you.  If someone turning a blinker on, or changing lanes, or moving past you at a reasonable speed delta is a surprise.. you should be paying more attention

2 - If you think everyone slower than you is an idiot, and everyone faster than you has a death wish.  
This is number one I think.  It speaks to one of two things (or possibly both).  First is arrogance.  I know better than everyone else and they should all drive like me.  Far more insidious is a lack of knowledge.  It could mean you have a lack of knowledge of the rules of the road.  As a consequence, it means you don't understand the real problem.  This is probably not your fault, as the government bodies designed to teach you such things perform abysmally.  The assumption here is that large deltas in speed ( different rates of speed ) are bad.  This is absolutely false.  It just requires a very basic, simple set of rules to follow, and everything would work just fine.  Unfortunately, those rules are almost universally disregarded.  It's easy to prove that speed deltas aren't bad.  If they were, a 25 mph road should never intersect with a 55 mph road, and all highways would have far larger merge lanes for onramp drivers to get up to the appropriate speed.

Interestingly, an equivalently false statement is that speed kills.  That isn't true - if you're travelling at speed the default state is to maintain that speed.  Drastic changes in speed kill.  The interesting thing is that seems counter to my original posit.  But if you know what the real problem is (change in speed kills - for example changing very rapidly from 80 mph to 0) - then you can develop a set of rules to provide for that problem.  If you think the problem is that speed kills, then you get stuck with byzantine rules like 55 mph speed limits.

3 - If you think troopers are your best protection.
You've all seen the bumper stickers that say this.  What a load of crap.  YOU (or your driver) are your best protection.  A trooper is not.  There are extreme circumstances where troopers come in very handy.  But in every day driving, they have very little to do with you.  That's the way it should be.

Troopers, of course, and their concurrent bureacracy would disagree with this.  That makes sense.  Their job security is dependent on them being an important civic function.  That's one of the frustrating things about government.  Once a body no longer has a real purpose, its purpose becomes to justify its own existence.

Travel in Europe a bit and you'll notice two interesting things.  First, that everyone follows certain rules.  For instance, passing on the left (or right, on the British Isles).  The equivalent is that if you're not going that fast, you stay on the right (or left).  And second, you'll see very few cops.  The only time I've ever seen cops on the road while *not* in a city is when passing an accident.  That's it.  They're function is to protect, not as an additional tax revenue source.  They have cameras for that.

There are also some equivalent statements that could be made for each of these.  For instance, if you think cell phones should be banned in cars for 3.  If you dn't like driving in the rain for 1.  If you think it's ok to drive in the left lane during rain storms for 2.  If you have no idea how your car's ABS work, or the grip of the tires for 1.  


Speed kills is false, speed deltas kill.. otherwise airplanes would be far less safe than cars, but by many measures this is not true.  Now if we except this new version.. then we're doing lots of things very stupidly when we design our road system.  Exit/Entry lanes for highway should never converge with much faster traffic (i.e. only on the right side).  Cloverleafs should allow the acceleration up to speed onto a highway, rather than diminishing that.  

Premature optimization on the road.  Two left hand turn lanes, etc..
