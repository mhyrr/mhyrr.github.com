Recently, a good friend and I had an interesting back and forth over email.  A snippet:

	Him: On the other hand, I really can't stand people who actually think that we are in 
	some unprecedented stage of human progress, siting facebook and twitter as two reasons!
	
	Me: You really don't think we are in an unprecendented age of progress?   I would say 
	FB and Twitter are more symptoms than signs, but I definitely think what's been 
	happening over the last ten or twenty years is new and game changing.
	
	Him: It's the word 'progress' that bothers me.  We have progressed in terms of noise.  
	In terms of information.  But Game changing?  [...]  Progress implies that man is striving 
	toward something.  What has the technological boom progressed?  I'm honestly curious.  
	I don't understand.

I don't understand either.  I don't really think anyone does yet.  But it seems reasonable to say that we are in a fascinating age of wonder and discovery, of speed and communication, of information and technology.

The human notion of progress presents a perception of constant forward motion even though it rarely is.  There are always side steps or backward steps before we eventually figure anything out.  We humans have no real foresight.  We're never sure of what the big leaps will be until we've found them, and they always seem obvious to us (and awesome) in hindsight.

Unquestionably, the last two hundred years have been an amazing leap forward for our world.  The Industrial Revolution sparked a huge amount of human productivity and invention.  There have been difficulties - we've spoiled ourselves, our fellow humans, and the environment (sometimes drastically) - but the world has become generally better in that time.  Cities are cleaner, life expectancies and infant mortalities are lower, and education and quality of life are higher.

In the last century, the improvements in technology have only quickened.  The computer especially has completely overhauled almost every field of study it has touched and has changed our ways of life permanently.  We've come to think of information, spatial distance between people, and communication completely differently than we did even ten or twenty years ago.

So where are all these changes leading?  What are we striving towards, as my friend so genuinely asked?  I hope to address this question and suggest a few parts of our lives that will continue to change, and hopefully for the better.

### The Age of the Internet

I remember many, including me, being surprised when Time magazine and others picked Johannes Gutenberg and his printing press to be the No. 1 most important person or invention of the 2nd millennium.  Lots of other inventions seem like they could eclipse the lowly printing press: Edison's light bulb, Newton's Principia, Tesla and AC power.  But before the printing press, every piece of information had to be meticulously transcribed by hand, something both time consuming and severely limited by human capital.  In producing the first way to easily produce and transmit information for a wide audience completely justifies Gutenberg's No. 1 placement.  

The only invention I would put in front of it is the Internet.

The Internet only just made it into the 2nd millennium, and when those lists were drawn up in '97, it was still very hard to see all of the potential.  Plus, the Internet and it's progress is a huge combination of human effort.  Even the largest contributors - the Tim Berners-Lee's and the Google's - only make up small fractions of the invention.

The Internet deserves to be Number One for the same reason that Gutenberg did: there is no better way to record information.  We are only in the opening volleys of the Internet Age, and we are only seeing the initial forms this information will take.  And yet the reach of this thing, already measured in billions of people, eclipses every medium that came before it.  Except books of course.

In order to propagate, every little idea, piece of information, or human thought needs a container for storage and transportation.  This container, we'll call it a bucket, must be stable to allow an audience of multiple people to "read" the same thing.  For ages the primary bucket has been the written word, usually a book.  Even if it was passed on verbally from person to person, or in a lecture, once it could be written down it lived much longer.  Where once the book was the only real option, the internet has drastically expanded the types of buckets available.  Storage and stable transport of information has never been easier.

Consider blogging as a small example.  People used to write in a journal with an audience of 1, give or take a few.  Later, they might send an email occasionally to a few people.  With a blog, what they have to say can be distributed to whomever can find it, a potential audience of everyone on the internet, and all of them will read the same thing.  It's no surprise then that there are more ideas-- or at least more words from more people fighting for the same attention.

Just like books, information and attention are the primary forces of computers.  The ability to perform computation has become incidental.  For the first sixty years or so, the primary measures of a computer were processors and memory.  In the last decade, those measures have changed to information and attention.  Except for perhaps a writer, a computer detached from the internet is almost completely worthless today.  

To borrow a word from religion, there is a soteriology of technology here.  'Computers' were originally human calculators; masses of people, usually women, who carried out numeric portions of larger problems.  We passed that off to huge machines that could do some of the same things.  As these machines got smaller and faster they were able to provide solutions for more problems, and they invented new problems to solve.  

Once they were connected together, they could disperse and touch nearly every problem humans have.  Computers deal with heart problems, medical imaging, space science, travel bookings and money transfers.  They manage stock markets and search for patterns in science and commerce.  They handle massive amounts of manufacturing and track agricultural efficiency.  Name a branch of modern humanity, and it's likely we would be far less sophisticated without computers.

This is literally the only human invention in the history of our civilization that can make such a claim.  The book is the only other thing that even comes close.  And this new technology is well less than a century old!  We are in the earliest infancy of an age of revolution. 

### A definition

Ok, you might say, this new technology we call computers has touched many parts of our lives.  It has led to unprecedented efficiency and information exchange.  What exactly is so revolutionary about that?  It's a change perhaps, an improvement hopefully, but a revolution?

I recently listened to an interview with ____ on econtalk.org.  He was talking about the idea of the singularity.  If you've heard of the notion, I'll say I don't really agree with most versions of the idea.  But his history is great.  

He outlined three major and dramatic changes in the history of our species.  The first was the start of our very existence anywhere from 100,000-300,000 years ago.  Our nomadic and comparatively squalid existence could be considered rough now, but our toolmaking and culture were a dramatic shift in the history of the Earth.

The next great shift was roughly 10,000 years ago when some of our nomadic ancestors stopped in place.  They decided to settle for awhile and took up farming.  Before this, humans generally subsisted on what they could catch at any particular time.  One person could only accommodate the food needs of several others at best.  But with farming, they could grow and produce much more than before.  Specialization of skills, cities, and most of culture were byproducts of this shift.

Most of our modern human history continued this way.  ____ mentioned that a farmer in Roman times would not be very out of place farming in 1600.  There were may have been a few improvements, but not much had changed.  Then the Industrial Revolution hit, and things changed dramatically again.  Our production abilities increased to never before seen numbers.  A single farmer could provide enough cotton for clothes or grain for food to satiate hundreds.  Others produced machines to process these goods, or to specialize in other never-before-used products.  The night was lit more than ever before, first by tons of whale oil lamps which replaced candles, then later by electric light bulbs.  Efficiency continued to multiply on itself, and population right along with it.  Humans increased in population from well under a billion in 1800 to over 3 billion in 1950 and 6 billion now.  In the 1960s, some thought our agricultural efficiency gains were over and untold millions would face starvation.  But then Borlaug proved them wrong with genetically modified wheat and continued the multiplying trend.

A farmer from the time of the American Revolution would have no idea how to survive in our world a mere 230 years later.  The changes are completely staggering.  

And we haven't even considered computers yet.  When we reply snarkily to our parents or grandparents about some computer problem, we're reminded of just how quickly things have changed.  Arthur C. Clarke famously defined technology as "anything invented after you were born."  These days, that's a lot.  And it's hard to keep up.

Still, the computer is an invention within the lifetime of many.  The actual machine has progressed far from some of the original ideas of people like Georg Boole and Ada Lovelace.  A few have even made modern versions of __  thinking Machine.  And it worked.

But the first real computers were in the 30s and 40s.  They had massive memory drums and enormous room-sized "CPU"s.  The history of these machines mirrors our own in improvement, but in microcosm.  The complete story has filled books, so I won't dwell here.  The transistor created dramatic improvements in speed, and Moore's Law has steadily held for over sixty years.

A lesser followed parallel track follows the application of these machines.  






Bucket theory, books and computers and the internet: the bucket of all smaller buckets..

Soteriology of computer languages.. you couldn't really use java to do what C did.. you can't really use X to do what Y did..  not that you couldn't in the Turing meaning, but that you couldn't in the humans-couldn't-grok-it way.  So are we evolving towards smaller DSL style languages for particular applications?  Variations on a theme?

Programming languages alone are a microcosm of this soteriology.  The original machine languages of the 40s and 50s were operationally sparse.  They were theoretically Turing-complete, but they could never do what later languages could do.  They had to be built on a big stack.  You had to have assembly to get C.  You needed C to get Java.  You needed well-defined machines and virtual machines to get higher-level languages.  Lisp stands out in this stack, because it's ancient but so detached from the machine itself.  Abelson said famously that "programs should be written for a human to understand, and only incidentally for a machine to compute" (get ) 


Definition of a computer: a novel container for information.  It's gone far past its original meaning of a complex calulator.  

Normalization as the most important thing we do.  It is our advantage over other animals.  It's what lets us build abstractions that don't leak too much and that we can build other abstractions on.  Again, not on the theorem-proving level, but on the humans-couldn't-grok-it level.  Example:  Truck heights and interpass heights.  If this wasn't normalized, all of commerce would essentially break down.

The internet will never go away... it will only absorb other types of info or networks..  

Access to it will become ubiquitous.  

The need for talking will decrease as ubiquity increases.. since the internet includes ways to communicate that are often far more efficient and impersonal (and thus "easier")

The perceived need for school will diminsh since so much knowledge can be found by search.

Humanity will increasingly cluster into cities or urban life but this will be based on information access rather than the older support structures.  

The power of a computer (aside from scientific computing) is also no defined by it' access to information.  A computer not on the Internet is now almost worthless..

A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention -- ?

The future of telepathy - how different is the way we text now from telepathy?  Only two improvements need to be made to reach what someone could legitimately call telepathy: we need a way to accept/read signals directly and we need a way to send signals directly, without the need to type or talk or whatever.  The second fo these is probably quite a bit harder, but neither should seem that far out at this point.  We're within a generation or two of achieving something like that.

Human communication - when people talk they talk over each other constantly, they don't listen, they don't  say what they mean and the other person doesn't get what they say.  College students embrace this in IM.  High school students embrace this in text.  I can, with written communication, embrace what I want to say as closely as possible with no such distraction as facing another human being directly.  I can accommodate my thought completely and then hopefully pass it on for appropriate response.

Does this sound stoic?  I hope not, it's a riot.  The written word, not speech, is the most fundamental communicative medium of civilization.  And it's the one that will last in the 21st century and beyond.  Not voice, not video.  Text.  There's a reason books have survived this long.


Kolmolgorov Complexity and compressibility.

What's the difference between communication and information?  Some people prefer texting to phones and typing to talking.  Is less communication generated this way, or less information?  Certainly two friends sitting with each other by a fire can have a more complete and engaging human experience than if they type over a keyboard from hundreds of miles away.  Perhaps the most intriguing point of inquiry is the carnal communication of sex.  Can this communication be defined as simply some set of information exchanged between people?  Or is there something incompressible about the experience that can't be reduced or defined?

The internet of things and how it will relate to the current internet.  How things will change.
