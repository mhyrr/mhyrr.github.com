Title: Why I Hate Windows

We've reached a point now where memory, cycles and other physical resources should not be bottlenecks to performance or capabilities.  This means, indirectly, that we can make things beautifully.  We can put millinos of colors on high resolution icons because we have the memory to do so.  We do NOT have the ability to do so if we're wasting that memory and those cycles on poor algorithms to do simple OS tasks.

What, at it's hear, is computer science?  Or even computers?  At the most fundamental level of abstraction -= it's math ( reference newest xkcd purity cartoon). Yes it's easy to scoff at the simplicity of this answer, especially when programmers and such don't really need to know math for their jobs (yegge link).

But really, what's going on here?  There is most definitely an algorithm with the most elegancefor a given sorting problem.  It may be radix sort or quicksort or even something simpler.  Given a problem space, I'm looking to maximize elegance.  That's really a hacker's job.What else is that if not mathematics?  In the same way a maximally elegant proof is better than another longer proof, so too is it true for algorithms.

We can step back up the abstraction tree now all the way ot interfaces.  How do I interact with my computing device (that little word switch tricks us into realizing what a computer still is fundamentally)  If I want to do elegant thing, don't I want to have an elegant way of looking at those things?

Interestingly, rthis same argument is the one often made for Lisp.  Right now I'm making it for why I love Apple (and hate Microsoft).  EVERYTHING aqbout Apple has design in mind.  and when you're talking about things that abstact down tom computations and constructions (math), design is equivalent to maximal elegance.  But the fact that the same case can be made for Lisp makes me really waht to pick up my Scheme book again and go to it.  because tyhe case for elegance is easy to make.  

Everytime I hop on a Windows PC I'm baffled.  Why am I still looking at these dull grey Window backgrounds?  Why are all the fonts so hideous?  Why are there still holdovers from mid-90s GUIs (or earlier?! Why is a DOS prompt still using \ instead of / ?!?!)  It's almost as if Dilbert's veal fattening pens have transposed themselves through our screens and onto our desktops.  It's the rough equivalent especially for anyone trying to get real work done with a computer (i.e. computation! or writing??? ).

Take two offices you're visiting for a new job.  One company shows you your cubicle - trashy somewhat adjusting office chair, nasty beige carpeted walls, hideous flickering flourescent lights.  They show you the coffee mess with the invitation to decorate the communal office door as a sign of faux company collegiality.

The next office shows you your office.  Four walls, a door, a window with natural light.   Plenty of rich wood shelving for books, a beautiful desk, an Aeron chair, and a recliner for thinking.  They takey ou outside to show you the barbeque and fire pit and the volleyball courts.

Which arey ou going to choose?

Now let's look at two computers you have to work with, to do computation.  One has grey windows wth hideous square edges everywhere - on dialogs that you don't want to pop up, on buttons, on the fonts.  You have to go to "start" to get to " Shut down" when you do get to Shut Down you have to navigate a stupid pull down menu evn though only 4 options exists.  All the icons look like there's an ancient memory requirement of 1K.  There's still some holdovers from when path names could only be 8 characters so you might occasionally see "PROGRA~1" instead of "Program Files".  And what are Program Files anyway?!

Now let's look at a second option.  This one has gorgeous fonts, with beautiful curves that are pleasing to the eye.  It has robust stability from a nearly 40 year old platform built right in.  It's _intuitive_.. all the behaviors are more or less what you'd expect.  Transparency and proper menu tyoes are used where deemed appropriate.  Folders and defaults are well chosen.

Which are you going to choose?

As a side note, I first started writing this on a Windows computer, because that's when I started thinking about it.  Would you like to know which application I used to write it?  Notepad.
