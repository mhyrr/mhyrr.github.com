Certain situations present themselves differently, and these may be used at various times.  I'm not good enough to provide the crosshatches that sugges these answers.  Instead they sort of seem to come up readily when needed.  In other words.. you'll know when they'll apply because you'll be thinking something very similar.

Caveats:

Everyone must have a somewhat diverse set of view points (more definition?)

Everyone must be smart

Next..  If there is any doubt, then there is no doubt.
