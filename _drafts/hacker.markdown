Defining what a hacker is.

There is one defining attribute of a hacker: the ability to learn and game a system of interest.

Note that that system is only incidentally a computer system - thus the more colloquial definition for a hacker.  That's incidental only because computer systems have such an interesting set of rules to game - the machines do literally exactly what you ask of them.

Hackers game other systems too.  Warren Buffer is a hacker of finance.  Mendel was a hacker of biology, producing plants of his own choosing using the system available to him.  Lots of others.

This one key attribute leads to several other common hacker attributes:

Hackers are intimately aware of the rules of a system.  What a system will explicitly do or not do and how those rules can be applied in every state of the system.

Hackers are intensely interested in the truth of a system.  Facades and marketing are of no interest, they simply hide the rules of a system that the hacker wants to learn (although the building of facades and marketing is a system to hack in itself)

Hackers are easily able to say "I don't know."  This isn't modest; in fact, hackers tend not to be humble since they consider themselves masters of whatever system they hack.  Rather, because they're interested in knowing the truth of the system deeply, they recognize the depth and understand that sometimes they really don't know.

Hackers tend to express their thoughts very particularly.  It is essential to be able to express the rules of a system explicitly, and the only way to do this between humans is language.  Thus hackers speak precisely.

Hackers like to experiment - this isn't really bending the rules of the system.. it's understanding what it will and won't do and how that differs from the expected or documented behavior.

In practice, most hackers share two practical traits: they can write and communicate well, and they can think at a meta-level.
