What are we teaching our kids?

Car washes typically fund some activity or some trip.  The parents expect that this self-funding teaches kids how to earn their own keep, or how to work towards something.  Does it really?  We're teaching them to get ready for mindless jobs that provide steady incomes really.  Do your two pence of work for your shilling.  If the skills the kids are learnign are really that important, why not let them focus on those skills instead of dealing with this mindless car washing?  What are they learning there?

Perhaps a different example would be better.  If my kid were working on some skill, let's just say he had this neat little idea for a webapp and he was doing a bunch of learning-- programming, etc.  When he got up to deploying and he needed $40/mo. for his hosting environment, I'm not going to make him go wash cars for two Saturdays and take him away from the important thing.  I'm going to GIVE HIM THE MONEY, so he can be busy continuing to learn this great skills he's interested.

Now, one can argue that cheerleading is not nearly as important as somethign productive.. say learning how to write, or how to program, how to do somethign creative, how to paint, or how to do science.  That's true, cheerleading is not as important.  I think deep down we know that, so we make our kids pay for it instead.

It would seem really ridiculous to make a student learnign to paint raise money in some stupid way to travel to an exhibit to show his portfolio.  It just sounds stupid being written out.

We're at this weird point with our children where there are traditional activities they do to add to their classroom learning.  You know, service oriented stuff.  In my day we had to sell magazines or pizzas.  Why?  

The worst is girl scout cookies.  What money does that raise aside from allowing the group to organize enough to sell girl scout cookies again the next year?  

If it's for service, is sitting out in front of a grocery store for hours selling a box here or there really what we want to teach our kids that service means?  I certainly don't..
