Title: Some Calculations

Two calculations, one for gas.. average commute times, plus average mileages to get average ridiculous amount per day of gallons that americans literally waste.  Probably a scary number.

Second calculation.. for food/land.  Average amount of airable land required to reasonably feed x number of people.. and then the number of people distributed across the US.. use a % of total land area for a more reasonable estimate.. Plus understand the lack of diffusin that exists.. i.e. city centers etc..  large and small scale.  This shouldn't cater to the marxist idea of actual redistribution of these things.. but we should understand what's possible so that we can understand how cities/towns/etc work.
