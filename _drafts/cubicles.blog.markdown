Cubicles have bad assumptions:

They try to pretend to be offices - thus striving for self importance of the cubee by mimicking a real office.

They try to provide personal, individual space and privacy, which doesn't actually exist at all, and is less important than other considerations

Workspaces should be quiet.


Even in large cube farms, a large number of people are usually divided into smaller teams.  These teams are the important unit.
