Title: Good Technology and Bad Technology	

Note on a stov ethat says "Err" when you hit a button.  How do you tell who has taste?  One way is to look at who uses technology for problems that don't need technology.  Who wants to put a big, bright LED screen on a toaster.  Understanding the uses of technology means understanding their limitations too.  A stove is, in large part, a solved problem.  If you can't do something drastically better, don't change the basic premise to use technology that it doesn't need. 

I see this a lot in "hobbyist" computer people.  Generally, they're good with computers, but they don't have any real theoretic background with them.  Computers are a toy.  These are generally the same people that want a new computer with the latest 1 GB video card.  They know all the specs and it seems like a great use of money, but they don't generally know what they'll need it for.  The Porsche and BMW brands became stigmatized because of people with similar motives purchasing those cars.  They had no idea what all the gadgets did, or how to use them, but they recognized them as a symbol of status.  Status doesn't mean what it used to.  It's become specialized in the same way that industry has become specialized.  And it means that someone's idols are generally going to be lesser known to a large percentage of the population outside that small specialization.
