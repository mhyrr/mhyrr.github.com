Story about virality on omg earthquakes and what happened

Led me to look at celebrity twitter feeds and how many followers they have, how quickly what they say get's out to huge masses of people..

Twitter tells you how the user posted to the account.  And almost every one I looked at said Twitter for iPhone or something similar.

Historically the difference between rich and poor has meant three things: the rich had more land, better goods and services, and more labor.

That's been changing as technology gets better and better.  It's been about a hundred years since the richest among us had armies of butlers, servants, kitchen staff and builders.  Those days are over.  Some celebrities might have ridiculous security staff, and some European nobility might still have castles to manage, but for the most part the rich take care of their own lives.

Now goods and services are changing too.  A landed noble in 1200 wore cotton and carmine and fur and maybe even some silk while the poor that worked the land wore rough wool at best.  Today's clothes are vastly better in every sector of society.  But the difference is even bigger than that.  We all wear the same types of clothes now - a rich person might wear expensive jeans but they're still jeans and the differences are orders of magnitude closer.

Now think about Apple products.  College students have and want the exact same phones that the rich and famous have and want.  The same tablet.  The same computer.  Most acknowledge the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers as the best there are.  

That is *new*.  The goods that the rich have or use have traditionally been vastly separated from the goods the poor have, or even the middle class.  Apple products are the first prime example I can think of where goods have truly been democratized over the entire socioeconomic spectrum.  It would be like the top-line Mercedes being accessible and desired by everyone.

What about land next?  How does this make us think about Apple's profit?
