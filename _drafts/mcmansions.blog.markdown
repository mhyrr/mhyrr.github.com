TED video.. putting together why suburbia doesn't work.. the notion of creating a town and how difficult it was originally to do that when the popoulation swas booming so substantially..

Why they won't work anyway (literally are a facade).. a friend told me that having dead bolts in those things is irrelevant since you can literally just walk through the drywall exterior if you've got a hammer.

Easy credit for awihle and the american dream.. followed by the downturn..
