### Worth

College, as it stands in the modern age, seems to have two real purposes.  The first is to produce more PhD's to feed back into the system, usually driven to continue to do research in their field.  But research is a relatively loose term at colleges today.  Usually it means that the professor is working on some theory with direct application to a field.  Many professors are starting companies to continue their labors.  The association with economic or industry applications is direct even at the post-doc level.

The places where pure unapplied research occurs are perhaps less common now than they used to be, and more constrained.  Mathematics is one example.  Specialized mathematics can be hard to place in application for decades or even centuries.

So we can ask, what is research?  Has the professor today just become another profession?  Does the title simply mean an academician?  Is rate of output the primary thing that leads to tenure?  Why?  Where do the truly revolutionary ideas come from in the 20th century?  Are they supposed to come from professors - heck, does that question even make sense?

At first, this cycle struck me as a negative trend, and I felt somewhat uncomfortable about today's crop of professors.  But I've changed tack.  The "Equal-Odds" rule suggests that people in a given field have equal odds to produce the Next Big Thing as they do to produce a ton of cruft.  In other words, you have to be prolific and willing to produce a lot of crap to also produce something amazing.  In addition, focusing on hard research problems is [sailing upwind](http://paulgraham.com/hs.html) - to use PG's nomenclature - to the problem of tenure.  Tenure is a [trivial problem](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/07/17/understanding_engineers_feasibility/), insofar as there is a well-formed solution to achieving it.  Solving or producing work on hard (non-trivial) problems is more difficult than receiving tenure.  

Interestingly, some of the most amazing human thought in recent decades - regardless of direct application - has come from pure research.  I'm thinking especially of Princeton's IAS and [Xerox's PARC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)#Legacy), but there are many others as well.  In the case of IAS, thought has been furthered in a phenomenal way with minimal attachment to funding, political stance, or today's issues.  In the case of PARC, a lot of IT and CS innovation was developed there in one complex in the 60s and 70s.  [Von Neumann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann#Computer_science) started computing as a small related endeavor to the Manhattan project.  The [laser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser#History) was first described as a solution without a problem.

Aside from the recycling process, the second far more common purpose for college is to produce relatively skilled workers for the commercial-industrial-political complex.  Widespread secondary education only started with the industrial revolution, and the continued forward economic progress of the world has only increased the desired skill level for the average worker.

Defining research and the purpose of higher education is an interesting inquiry.  I think they are linked.  The added common purpose of producing relatively skilled workers feels like a key to the connection.  Perhaps the industrial and technological advances of the last couple hundred years have closed the gap between what used to be the abstract fields of academics and the more everyday applications of real life?  Perhaps the graduating senior is only so different from the new PhD as a matter of degree.

But what does that mean for how we think of colleges?  Has our cultural template for college kept up with the changes?

### Prestige

Now I feel a bit weird talking about college prestige.  Two people in my life are closely tied to recruiting and marketing for two different colleges.  So with that in mind, I want to be specific.  Choosing a college, if you go to college, is very important.  It will effect your outlook on the world in a profound way and it can be some of the best years of your life.  Choosing wisely to make the most of your life is important, but the definition of "choosing wisely" probably has a different set of criteria than most people think.

One of those wrong criteria is often prestige.  Don't be fooled by prestige.  The question of prestige is a much different one than which college will provide you the best (learning) experience.  Prestige is a combination of branding, honor, history, and, only minimally, rigor.  Once you're out of college, where you went is virtually meaningless in most cases.  There isn't a long gradient of prestige, which is what I think most colleges try to make you think.  

As far as prestige, there are in fact four types.  Here they are:

  * Harvard.  Look, if you get into Harvard, you ought to go.  The complete short list is Harvard, Yale, Princeton.  MIT and Caltech are the tech equivalent.  Oxford and Cambridge on the other side of the pond.

    Why is this true?  When Harvard existed in the 18th century, who went there?  General education in the same form as today didn't exist then for a very good reason: most people didn't *need* it.  It wasn't something they would use to make money and to support themselves.  Jobs didn't ask for their major.  Then the industrial revolution hit, and suddenly everything changed.  But the original purpose of the Harvard's, the Yale's, the Cologne's.. they were for the most creative people to pursue the most creative arts in the world and for the most scientifically proficient to pursue the most scientific.  It wasn't education the same way that college is now.  And it still isn't in some sense.

  * Very good colleges.  This is the rest of the Ivy League schools, Stanford, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Virginia, University of Chicago, Duke, etc.

  * Specific prestige for specific schools: Wharton School of Business, high ranking tech departments.  

  * Everything else.  Sorry, that's just the way it is.  There's no difference between Western Random State University and Typical College.

This is not a justification for going to any of these schools.  An experience at Typical College may in fact be far better than lots of other schools.  You might meet your spouse there.  And there's nothing here about educational standards or finances.  In fact there's nothing here about anything except prestige.   Prestige is one of the prime marketing tools for colleges.  But the hype about prestige is largely irrelevant, especially when it comes to getting a job after college.  In the rare cases it is relevant, you already know the college name (Harvard) and they don't need to market much.

A lot of colleges might disagree with this.  **You** might disagree with it, and that's a testament to how well colleges market prestige, because what I'm actually advocating is that it doesn't matter at all.  They'll tell you that it matters where you go, that their English department is better than other schools of a similar size or price.  Their swimming pools are bigger, the dorms are better, the computer labs are more complete.

No.  For the core competency of any college - that is to say *learning* - none of that matters at all.  I heard the provost of some university or other on NPR a week ago saying (paraphrase) "but we're an academic institution.  Teaching is what we do."  Funny, I thought the purpose of academic institutions is learning.  There's a difference.  You can teach to a completely passive audience. 

Which is why none of these things really matter.  A good professor can enhance and encourage the learning of their interested students, but not their disinterested students.  A student can, however, still learn in spite of a bad professor.  Even when there are good professors, interested in teaching rather than research, how often are the grades and classes based off the grad student TAs instead?

A good student can learn anywhere.  They can learn in a great class or a bad class.  In class or outside of class.  In school or outside of school.  

Harvard may have exceptional facilities and great professors, but I bet they also have more inquisitive, curious and interested students per capita than other schools too.

The sad thing about this is that we've deluded ourselves as a culture into believing that college is a mandatory requirement for everything.  A continued 4 years of teaching - or perhaps training - is required after high school before entering nearly any field.  

Adults think this is true.  College students think something else.  They see college as a time of learning, which is a far better perspective than the adults have.  Unfortunately, college students (including me at the time) think of their learning as being predominantly outside the classroom.  It's a time to learn how to live, how to schedule days, how to have fun, hopefully how to begin shouldering a bit of responsibility.  But more often, it seems to be a continuation of the social press of high school with a wider reach.

Given a college life of actively shunning many responsibilities, of partying and drinking, it seems unsurprising that graduates often expect to be handed a standard job of starting salary plus benefits.  The average starting college job these days is a continuation of shunning responsibility.  It's lackluster. Students have spent four or more years being given a fake world of idle and idyll bliss.  It's usually not the real world.

I know I'm drawing huge stereotypes of the average college student here.  I don't want my reference to partying or drinking to be taken out of context; I know not all college students drink their life away.  The more pressing issue is the malaise and lack of initiative that stems from the assumption that college is a requirement for any job and, because of that, that it doesn't much matter what you do aside from graduate.

### Majors

One of the biggest detractors from the past substance of a college education is the majors themselves.  A major should be a specific field of more intense study, but the push towards a ubiquitous college education has diluted the pool of available majors.  The most popular majors today seem to be English, Communications, Marketing, Business, Management, Accounting, Education, Exercise Science, and Psychology (These taken from college websites, most prominently BYU).   The long tail of majors has changed too, to include things like Recreation and Leisure Services Management, Bowling Services Management, and Ornamental Horticulture.  Now here's the thing, I'm all for specialization - continuing an advanced civilization requires it.  But the problem is that specialization doesn't mean anything, again because of the whole college-education-is-ubiquitous thing.

But back to the most common majors, things like Marketing, Business and Communications.  What do these mean and what do folks with these majors do after college?  We have a very interesting environment now where a lot of marketing and business majors dream of being managers and come out as executive assistants.  Meanwhile, folks with psychology, education, and child development masters degrees plan on leading schools and end up with jobs at daycares and after-school programs.  So these placements are thought of as entry-level positions, a way to "get your foot in the door".  

So here's a hard but honest question.  Think about some of the more rigorous disciplines: physics, math, any engineering.. when was the last time you heard about someone coming out of school with a degree in one of these subjects not being able to land a job?  Never, right?  Why the difference?

One possible explanation is market saturation.  There is a huge need for engineers of any discipline.  The same is true for nursing; they are always in demand everywhere.  But the need for marketing folks, or specialists in early childhood development may be smaller, or at least the market may already be covered.

I think this only fulfills a partial explanation.  We hear on the news all the time that the growing need for teachers is an important problem in our society.  And the advertising business is absolutely enormous, supporting huge companies like Google, not to mention the entire TV market.

So the needs are there.  Why would a marketing major or a child development masters candidate have such problems?

The underlying problem here is the underlying difference between how these fields are taught.  Alas, I fear I will offend people by saying this even though it seems obvious: *not all degrees are created equal*.  A physics degree is much more rigorous than a degree in marketing.  It means more.

Here's what I mean: let's say I'm looking to hire for a position in a field completely unrelated to both physics and marketing.  I have two candidates, both with good qualifications that have moved between fields.  One has a degree in marketing and the other has a degree in physics.  All other things being equal, I would favor the candidate with the physics degree.  Why?  Because they made it through physics, which means they have a certain amount of logical and intellectual rigor, and they know how to think critically.  It doesn't mean the candidate with the marketing degree cannot think critically, it means I have more certainty that the physics candidate can.

And that is the core problem: the issue that higher education is designed to tackle has been lost.  It's not the fault of the marketing major.  They've progressed forward into what they expected to be a promising career field based on the input of the colleges they apply to, the high schools they attend, big businesses, and their parents.  And it's not only the wrong answer, it's the wrong question.

A week ago the New York Times ran an editorial called "College The Easy Way".  An excerpt:

> Intellectual effort and academic rigor, in the minds of many of the nation’s college students, is
> becoming increasingly less important. According to the authors, Professors Richard Arum of New York
> University and Josipa Roksa of the University of Virginia: “Many students come to college not only poorly
> prepared by prior schooling for highly demanding academic tasks that ideally lie in front of them, but —
> more troubling still — they enter college with attitudes, norms, values, and behaviors that are often at
> odds with academic commitment.”
>

True and we all know it.  This is exactly why so many people move on to complete master's degrees.  The bachelor's degree has less meaning.  So to get a leg up on competition people drive towards additional degrees.  In many less rigorous fields, it takes a master's for what a decade ago a bachelors would have accomplished.

### Rigor

That word seems to keep coming up.  Part of the problem is that, in modern terms, it has a very specific meaning.  In the preface to "An Intelligent Person's Guide to Philosophy", Roger Scruton describes the problem:

> Philosophy is not the only subject that has been 'scientized' by the modern university: literature has
> been shrunk to 'literary theory', music has been colonized by set theory, Schenkerian analysis, and
> generative linguistics, and architecture has been all but abolished by engineering.  Pretended science
> has driven honest speculation from the intellectual economy, just as bad money drives out good.  This
> Gresham's law of the intellect operates wherever university teachers in the humanities exchange knowledge
> and imagination for the chimera of scientific 'research'.  A philosopher should certainly make room for
> scholarship: but scholarship has no 'results', no explanatory 'theories', no methods of experimentation. 
> It is, at best, a spiritual discipline, and what will emerge from scholarship depends intimately on the
> soul of the person who engages in it.  

Believing what Scruton says, I feel somewhat sheepish using a physics major to compare in my example above.  One thing science does well is provide a reasonable system of rigor based, at its core, on reason and maths.  What it does poorly, especially when taught, is break the connection between scholarship, intuition, and the given field of study.  The modern science student infrequently engages their soul in their study.  They never, as [Whitman would suggest](http://www.bartleby.com/142/180.html), "[look up] in perfect silence at the stars."  

This separation is sad enough in fields like physics, where intuition and philosophic fields like epistemology have played such a major role in the last two centuries.  How much more sad is it when subjects are 'scientized' out of place?  If the english major, for instance, is reduced to literary theory and analysis, who is going to teach the next generation of poets to write evocatively and stir our souls?  It won't be our universities.

### Work

But perhaps it never was in the first place.  Perhaps the frequency with which true art, science, and scholarship have been associated with higher education is statistically uncorrelated.  Historically, only a minority of the population was ever capable of such feats because only a minority received an education.  But as the fundamentals of language and accessibility to resources (i.e. the Internet) increases for all of humanity, this lack of correlation will become more noticeable.  It certainly diminishes the idea that research is one of the principal reasons for education.  Which means the only real reason for higher education, as it stands today, is training and specialization for a continually more advanced commercial and industrial civilization.

This newly trained workforce expects to get jobs out in the world.  They write cover-letters and resumes.  They interview and maybe get placed in a 9-5 job with a cube and a lunch break.  And they expect to do that for forty years or so before having enough money to retire and do nothing.  (It's sad that most people think of retirement as a time when they don't have to work.)  If they don't get a job, they keep working at it by writing more cover-letters and applying to more jobs in the hopes of getting their foot in the door so that they can "do something."   Compare this with writer Elizabeth Gilbert who, in her TED talk at the age of 40, estimated she had "about four decades left of real, solid work left in me."
Compare this with [Scott's dire situation, struggling to get on the bottom rung of the jobs ladder](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/08/this_is_why_the_american_dream.html).

The biggest disservice to humanity from higher education is the intense focus on this process.  It points everyone towards the idea of a "job".  Almost nobody I know focuses on or considers "work" anymore.  The two words have become completely interchangeable.  

It cannot be understated how profound this equivalence is.  Work - in proper context to humanity - ought to be a joyous and fulfilling activity in a way that a job rarely is.  Work also ought to have no set equality to the gain of money that a job usually does; even more unfortunate today where a job is usually a direct trade of time for money.

The really odd thing about those stuck in the cover-letter/resume/interview thing is that there is no better time to do or learn to do work.  Being unemployed provides an abundance of time to write, to learn a trade, to learn to draw, to learn to think more, to do any of a huge number of activities that enrich individuals and have the potential to enrich humanity.  But those stuck in that cycle don't think they can do any of those things without a job.  And nearly everyone, including the latent deep-thinkers of this generation, are subsumed into that role because that's where universities direct them.  When you step outside the process, it sounds like the weirdest thing for higher education to do.  



### Fixing the System

Community college, skilled labor, thinking and Veritas 

Fixing the condition of an enjoyable and work-filled life for the majority, and enabling them to think beyond the conditions education sets them now.  But also allowing an environment where those that both can and want to  to think.

"Perhaps you, Dear Reader—like me—are surprised to learn that a hotbed of scholarly inquiry like UNLV actually has a philosophy department in the first place. But, putting aside any special needs UNLV might have concerning the ontology or metaphysics of college basketball, or the ethical justification for bribery of student athletes, I suppose it makes sense, if only for the sake of curricular completeness."

Wealth and colleges.. the lone basketball player on his own court at Ithaca.  Seeing people meet each other in the gym there.  One of the most striking purposes of college is to clump people together.  In the best cases, smart people with similar interests clump together, but even generally people clump.

*Universities are what towns ought to be!*

Craftsmanship!!!  We, engineers, scientists are by and large craftsmen on a different part of the spectrum from woodworkers or architects.

### Conclusion?


Somewhere along the way, college stopped being about learning how to think for the betterment of ourselves, our work and our leisure, and started being a prerequisite for a job.  It became a value proposition, where a certain amount of predestined background training was proffered as a dowry for a certain level of salary and benefits.  This value proposition is the root cause of the losing battle to debt that college students face now.  As colleges have tried to engineer the level of the proposition, the payout in salary has not kept up.  Once we revert back to the original purpose of college, craftsmanship and knowledge, the abilities of our thinkers won't suffer from myopia due to such a shallow payoff.

The joy of human existence, in all its fragility, deserves better than a Sisyphean pursuit of jobs.  The transformation of higher education to attain this goal alone sets us all back.  The student becomes an employee.  The professor becomes a teacher of the incoming semi-trained industrial workforce.  [Our thinkers](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/lit/chapter5.html) become absent.  And all of humanity will miss them for their poetics, their dialectics, their art, and their science.



##### A personal footnote

For a long time I had a lot of trouble with where I went to college.  I went to the University of Maryland - a fine school - and the root cause of my frustration was that I thought in retrospect that maybe I should have gone to UVA or MIT or someplace more.. *prestigious*.  But in writing this I've started to realize that when I look back on my experience at Maryland, the thing I really struggle with is rigor.  I expect that somewhere else would have been more rigorous.

I've since blown a big wide hole in my own thought process on college.  Half or more of the reason I'm frustrated with my time spent there is frustration at myself.  *I* should have been more rigorous.  *I* should have paid more attention.  *I* should have been more ambitious.  I would have liked the opportunity to have professors that led me in the right direction, but placing that onus squarely on a teacher's shoulders is avoiding the problem.  Learning, not teaching.  The idea of guidance is correct here, wherein an inquisitive student can be guided to learn more.  But the main focus is learning.  I place too much blame on my college experience on where I went and not enough on the process and on myself.
