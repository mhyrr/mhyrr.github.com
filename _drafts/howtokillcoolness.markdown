Title: How To Kill Coolness

Describe the iphone guy and how I put mine away because I didn't want to be associated with that.  The bolle glasses, the slightly pudgy, trying to be hip but not succeeding clothes, the silhouetted nosehairs, and the video games.

Make something mainstream and it's power will die.  Tkae video games and make them something lots of fifty year olds do after work and kids won't want to do them.

Imagine a world where spouting off about variables x and y squared is cool for kids because the adults don't know it.  Begin countercultural.
