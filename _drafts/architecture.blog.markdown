Title: Architecture and What It Tells Us

Architecture is hard.  Think of the most beautiful buildings you know of.  How old are they?  I'll bet most are hundreds of years old.  The only exceptions could possibly be those that are beautiful because of engineering rather than architecture - e.g. skyscrapers and their ilk.  In fact, can you think of any building based on a design that is less than a hundred years old that is beautiful because of it's architecture?
