title: What Do I Need To Live?
---

Part of the problem of the Spanish Main, aside from it's whimsy and romance, is the fleeting touch of it with our own reality.  We can't ever seem to grasp it or hold it for any amount of time.

I've become convinced that the more simplicity and elegance we have in our lives, the more credible the question of the Spanish Main becomes.  To that effect, I've started thinking about what I really need to live.  What items are completely indispensable?  What maintains me and helps me understand more about who I might really be?
