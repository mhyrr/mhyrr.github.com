Why are vampires so popular in culture right now?

Examples: Twilight books and movies, Charlaine Harris', True Blood (based on), Vampire Academy, The Historian a few years ago

What's the draw? "Meyer has, like one of her vampires, turned into something rare and more than merely human.... People do not want to just read Meyer's books; they want to climb inside them and live there." -Time

Ever notice the girl is always human and falls in love with a male vampire?  

I get made fun of frequently by a couple of friends because I've read them/

Reasons:

We don't have any better popular way to deal with death, so we produce an "out":
We seek to understand the interplay between the idea of an immortal soul and the ephemeral human body we have.  So we anthropomorphize that soul into a (potentially soulless) immortal being.  Note Epidermal Macabre.  We see our own bodies both much worse and much better than they actually are, so when the vampire throws a car, or jumps a 100 ft. river.. somehow we identify with that.  But we also identify with the fragility of the human in the presence of such things.

We have no better popular way for trying to understand love in the dimension of life as ephemeral, so we immortalize it into something that "lasts forever"

We feel the urge to have immeasurably strong bonds with others.  Bonds so strong they deal in blood.
Blood bond, blood secret, sealed in blood.  What could be closer between two beings than the sharing of blood?

A common set of rules exists that can be followed easily by a popular audience:
garlic, stakes, immortality, blood, the night.  Generally twisted slightly by the author for their own touch.

We love secret societies
