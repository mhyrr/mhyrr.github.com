Is there some moral hazard or limit to when you need to consider the value of things?  How does this relate to Hayek's theory of knowledge in economics?

How does knowledge or measuring value change things?

Price signals and branding

Opposite side.  Value of time and money

Examples:

Prediction: Usain Bolt will never again break a world record in the 100 or 200.  (maybe in 400 or long jump).  Or if he does, it will be very small improvements.

Other athletic examples, anything with lots of measurement (or predictions/expectations)

The measurement of speed on the internet, or claiming to be very fast, makes people judge you more.

The claim of security makes people judge you more.

Car washes and girl scout cookies.  

The red cross selling donuts

Charities giving away stuff vs. paying fo rit.

Can combine this with lxury goods.  What is value?
