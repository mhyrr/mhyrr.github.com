### Awareness

I conform, and they  
see it as maturity.  
But I know better.  

### Patience 

Articulation  
is a precise art, and so  
I fear my great thoughts.  

### Death 

Knowing that the end  
Is not the end of all things  
Allows one to live.  

### Example 

Birds fly focused-- on  
Important matters, but what  
If I'm not that smart?  

### Constant  

Metamorphosis  
does not end with shedding a  
butterfly's cocoon.  

### Silence  

All that I can do  
sometimes is shake my head in  
exasperation.  

### Towards Faith 

Tyrannical doubt  
holds the truth hostage in the  
guise of longing hope.  

### Growing Old

Being wrong is hard  
And more conscious as time is  
Inexorable.
