## Language

Philology is an interesting study.  Tolkien was a diehard - that alone should tell you something.  He invented something over 20 languages in his lifetime.  I've always been horrible with foreign languages, which is perhaps amusing given that I write code for a living.  Code is something different though, more a grammar and a syntax than actual language.  But it has the same abilities in articulating dense thought.

Anyway, I've been keeping a list over the past couple of years of words I come across while reading that are interesting.  Many I'd never heard before.  Some just sound interesting, or in some other way provide a revelatory glance into their meaning without just simply looking up the definition.
