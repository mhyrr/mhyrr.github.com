			"Unsurprisingly inspired by a certain book and a certain movie.  And the two of you.\n\n\n\n\nThe next morning it finally felt real.  The whole night I mean.  Sometimes moments just happen.  Moments happen all the time of course, those aren't the ones I'm talking about.  The ones I mean turn your life on it's side.  Those kinds of moments dance around you, landing lightly with gossamer wings, and then they're off with the next breath.  Unremembering, only remembered.\n\nIt's 7 am now and Sarah's probably off to New York by now, two full weeks before I leave.  She was always ahead of schedule.  When I showed up five minutes late for our first date - the proper time to arrive, according to ettiquette - she was already checking her watch.  She didn't check her watch last night.  There wasn't any time then.  There was just us and a lot of unremembering.\n\nI knew last night was the last night before she left, and I couldn't help thinking it was the last night we had together.  After all the parties, and all the happy laughter, Sarah and I were left standing in an almost empty parking lot.  We stayed near my car as if the empty space scared us, and we were alone except for the streets around the school, filled with the city.\n\n\"Do you think college will change us?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.\" I nodded.\n\n\"Why does it have to change us?\"  And she moved a little closer.  She tucked her hair behind her ear the way I liked.  I took the opportunity to adjust my body and lean against the car.\n\n\"Doesn't everything change us?\" I asked back.  She looked at me then, but only quickly.  She didn't want me to see the mascara on her cheeks, I think, but the moment I remember from just then is the sad little smile, and the persimmon streaks in her hair catching little fireflies from the parking lot lights.\n\n\"Not to you.\" she said.  \"Every day you seem the same.  You walk down the same streets and you come to the same school.  Every day is a regular day in your amazing life.  And you never said I love you to me.\"\n\nI had thought we were just being whimsical.  Now I had to think.\n\nShe looked at me again and I knew I had to start thinking of the right thing to say, but I couldn't.  I just thought I could touch her heartbeat.  \"Why didn't you say it?\" she asked.\n\nThe street suddenly erupted, all flashing noise and glaring lights as two police cars came flying through the nearest intersection and went careening off on some errand.  We both jumped and whirled around on instinct, catching each other to make sure everything was ok.   \n\n\"Come on\", I said, after catching my breath.  \"We should go home.\"\n\nShe nodded as if that made sense, but I knew it didn't.  And I didn't try to get in the car either, I just let her take my hand and raise her face to mine, like she's done a thousand times before.  And I bent down just a bit, as I had done a thousand times before, and I felt her come up onto her toes.  And I could touch her heartbeat again.  And I really kissed her for the first time, and she really kissed me back.  It was awhile until I managed to say, \"I love you.\"\n\n\"I love you,\" Sarah said back, and I could feel her smiling with my lips.  I knew the lights in the parking lot were still catching her shimmering persimmon hair, and she still had mascara on her cheeks, and her hair was still tucked behind her ear the way I liked.  It didn't matter because I could touch her heartbeat.  \n\nLast night we drove home with the windows down, even though we were freezing.  It was just one of those nights.  We turned up the old speakers in my truck until I could hear them crackling and collapsing on every beat.  Sometimes the music can't get loud enough.\n\nWhen I dropped Sarah at her house, it took another long time to say goodbye.  I don't know how long.  I don't think Sarah knew either even though she loved being punctual.  And I loved that she loved being punctual.  And I loved that she didn't care just then.\n\nAnd I loved her.  I'm glad I realized it.\n\nShe whispered in my ear right before I left.  She didn't say \"I love you\" again, we'd sorted that out.  When you kiss someone like we kissed, you don't need to say it.  Instead, she turned my perfect little life on it's side again, the way only she could.   She took my sameness and chucked it out the window with the blasting music and made me change.  Made me better.\n\n\"We'll have it all, one day,\" she breathed.  \"Until then, it's ok to fuck up a little.\""
